## The History and Meaning of Dicitencello Vuie
  
Dicitencello Vuie is not only a beautiful song, but also a piece of Italian cultural heritage. It was composed in 1930 by Rodolfo Falvo, a Neapolitan musician who wrote many popular songs in his career. The lyrics were written by Enzo Fusco, a poet and journalist who collaborated with Falvo on several occasions.
  
The song is a classic example of the Neapolitan song tradition, which combines romantic melodies with poetic expressions in the local dialect. The title means "Tell Her You Love Her" in Neapolitan, and the song is about a man who is too shy to confess his feelings to the woman he loves. He asks his friend, who is also the woman's friend, to tell her how much he loves her and how he suffers for her. He describes her as a rose of May, more beautiful than a sunny day, and he wishes to hear that she loves him too.
  
However, in the last verse, there is a twist: the friend he is talking to is actually the woman he loves. He realizes that she has a tear in her eye, and he understands that she feels the same way. He then tells her directly that he loves her more than anything, and that she is his gentle dream.
  
The song was an immediate success and became a classic of the Neapolitan repertoire. It was performed by many famous singers, such as Tito Schipa, Beniamino Gigli, Luciano Pavarotti, Andrea Bocelli, Mario Lanza, and many others. It was also adapted into English with the title "Just Say I Love Her", and recorded by artists such as Vic Damone, Dean Martin, Tony Bennett, Nina Simone, and others.
  
Dicitencello Vuie is a song that expresses the universal theme of love in a simple and touching way. It is a song that has crossed borders and generations, and that still resonates with people today.
